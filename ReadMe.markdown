## MovingImages examples

This is a catch all repository for ruby scripts that work with MovingImages.

The JSON output from some of the ruby scripts will also be saved with the intention that people can see the sort of JSON MovingImages expects. Also that users won't need to install MovingImages to get a flavour of what the JSON looks like.

The "demovideo_script.rb" creates the demonstration video on the MOVINGIMAGES page of the website.

The contents in the gettingstarted folder is the scripts related to the video series getting started with scripting moving images.
